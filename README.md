Minimal flickering audio stream visualizer.
The stream is currently embedden in the .py file, but this might change. 
New request that instead of using a somewhat unstable stream we should use a option to play a media file straigt from a USB stick. 

Autostart added to bash.bashrc
This is a updated line
